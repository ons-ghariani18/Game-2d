# Game-2d-Esprit
The game is called "Choufli Dwe" and was developed by the Technocrates group. We used the C programming language along with the SDL library, with the support of Linux. 
This project was created as part of the end-of-year project at ESPRIT, under the theme of sustainable development. This game is focused on mental health
